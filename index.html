        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The final project I would be interested in for this class would be to create a full stack site using Node.js or React which implements REST APIs, 
            the emphasis of this project is going to be more on the tools and techniques of debugging in theses environments.  The Client side will be minimal 
            but will showcase the debugging process. </p>
